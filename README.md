# homeassistant-snoo-smart-bassinet

This repository was inspired by [Peter Hardy's version](https://bitbucket.org/pjhardy/homeassistant-snoo/src/master/). My version was created in order to change incorporate [Martin Riedel's version of pysnoo](https://github.com/rado0x54/pysnoo). I recommend giving these two props for their hard work for enabling me.
